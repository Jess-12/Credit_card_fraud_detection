# Credit_card_fraud_detection

Machine learning models can recognise unusual credit card transactions and fraud. The first and foremost step involves collecting and sorting raw data, which is then used to train the model to predict the probability of fraud[2]. The solutions offered by machine learning for credit card fraudulent detection involve:

Classifying whether credit card transactions are authentic or fraudulent using algorithms such as logistic regression
